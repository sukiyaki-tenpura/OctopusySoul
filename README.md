# Octopusy Soul Project

  Research and development of simple frequency counter with 8bit 8pin PIC processer.

  Octopusy Soul is a project to maximize power of 8bit 8pin PIC.
  Respecting the Soul of the Octopus, special ability is demonstrated in 8bit 8pin PIC.

  Only device-independent part is open to the public, device-dependent part is included
  in library. It is in the following path for each device

    OctopusyFifteen.X:  PIC16F15313
    OctopusyEighteen.X: PIC16F18313

  To burn to device EEPROM, HEX file is in the following path of each directory.

    {project_path}/dist/default/production/{project_name}.production.hex

  Documents and Schematics are in Documents directory.

  Email me about device-dependent parts. I don't always reply. Please understand it.
